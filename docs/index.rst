Documentation for thompsons_v
=============================

`Nathan Barker <https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~nb443/research.html>`_ and `Andrew Duncan <http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~najd2/>`_ are currently preparing a paper entitled *The power conjugacy problem in Thompson's group* :math:`V`, which describes an algorithm to solve the power conjugacy problem in the Higman-Thompson groups :math:`G_{n,r}`.

.. epigraph::
	
	[AS]_ Given two elements :math:`x` and :math:`y` of a group, are there integers :math:`a` and :math:`b` and a third element :math:`z` for which :math:`x^a = zy^bz^{-1}`? If so, provide them.

This package aims to implement that algorithm; to do so it provides tools for with the algebra :math:`V_{n,r}`, a certain set of :mod:`words <thompson.word>`.

.. warning::
	
	For the most part, this documentation is automatically generated by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ , so it's not the prettiest thing that's ever been written. But it's on my to-do list to make it better!


Package contents
----------------

This package began as a series of tools to represent tree pair diagrams in `Thompson's group <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups>`_ :math:`V = G_{2,1}`, hence the name. The focus has moved away from trees and dyadic partitions, and more towards mappings between bases of words.
