.. Thompson's V documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Thompson's V's documentation!
========================================

This package works with the algebra :math:`V_{n,r}`. Ultimately, the aim is to implement an algorithm for the power conjugacy problem in :math:`G_{n,r}`---in particular in Thompson's group :math:`V = G_{2,1}`. At the momentit consists of two chunks:

1. **Trees:** classes that store and draw pairs of trees which represent elements of :math:`V`. 
2. **Words:** classes that represent and work with words in :math:`V_{n,r}`, which are like paths in *n*-ary trees. 

This documentation is generated by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ mostly automatically, so it's not the prettiest thing that's ever been written. But it's on my to-do list to make it better!
