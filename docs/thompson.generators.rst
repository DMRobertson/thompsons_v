Suppose we have a map :math:`f \colon V_{n,r} \to V_{n',r'}`. If this is just a set map then we would have to specify the image of every word in :math:`V_{n,r}`. However, if :math:`f` preserves structure then it is sufficient to specify the image of a generating set---or even better, a basis---for :math:`V_{n,r}`. Such maps :math:`f` are called *homomorphisms*. The next module describes isomorphisms in terms of the image of a given basis.
